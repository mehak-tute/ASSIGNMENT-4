# ASSIGNMENT-4
This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate basic file handling operations in Python.

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

1. Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`.
2. Prints its content line by line.
3. Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

1. Takes user input and writes it to a file named `output.txt`.
2. Appends additional data to the same file.
3. Reads and displays the final content of the file.
